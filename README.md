# planet_imagery_download

Planet provides a basic notebook to use their API. However, for one of my tasks, I had to download images for different location at a single shot. So, I modified the planet API and built this script to make the process easier for me.

If you have a bunch of geojson for your locaiton, you can use this script to pull planet imagery for every location.
